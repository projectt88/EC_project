### **Molecular Subtypes of Endometrial Cancer**
Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common cancer affecting the female reproductive system. Four molecular subtypes of EC were identified based on mutation characteristics, copy-number alterations, and microsatellite instability: POLE ultramutated (POLE), microsatellite instability (MSI) hypermutated, copy-number low (CN-low), and copy-number high (CN-high).

The Problem in the Clinical Identification of EC Molecular Subtypes
These subtypes have a significant impact on patient prognosis and treatment options. However, current methods of determining molecular subtypes, such as sequencing or the ProMisE method, are expensive and time-consuming. This study aims to develop a new molecular biology diagnostic approach based on DNA methylation for identifying the molecular subtypes of EC, which could be a supportive, economical, and fast tool in addition to the current methods.


###  **The Results**
After CpG screening, we discovered that only 13 CpG positions showed significant differences in methylation levels among the four subtypes of EC. We used these 13 selected probes to build a multiclass log-linear model via a neural network, with an accuracy of 0.78 and an overall AUC of 0.91. The model also was robust when validated on external datasets, with an AUC of 0.93. Interestingly, we observed that 4 of 13 CpG positions were located in the promoter region of the MLH1 gene, which was hyper-methylated in the MSI subtype.
